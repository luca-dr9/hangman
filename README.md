# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

This is part of my AIcore course, this project is to create a hangman game using GitHub and Python. Each milestone python file is an improvement on the other.

Run mileston_5.py and simply play hangman, guess a letter and try to get the word before you run out of lives.

## Roadmap
* milestone_2 is where I created the variables for the game.
* milestone_3 is where I checked if the guessed character is a valid guess and if it is in the word. Created functions to run what I had coded.
* milestone_4 is where I created the game class. Defined what happens if letter in word or not.
* milestone_5 is where I coded the logic of the game and added winning/losing.
